            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> First thing to know about me is I belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I say this first because it is the thing that has defined my life the most. I have lived my life trying to live by the principles I believe in and the knowledge I have of the importance of Jesus Christ in my life. Second thing to know, I love web development, and to an extent I think that is the most important thing when considering to hire me for your page. When you find someone who's passion is in the line of work you are offering that person will be the best asset to your team and company in general. I started programming with visual basic back when I was 12. My father was in computer development long before they were even out for public consumption. He taught me the basics of creating an application for computers at that time and was surprised by my progress 4 days later when I was creating dynamic elements and working with array methods. Life happened and I kind of lost that passion for a while and when I started up again I realized this was indeed my calling. I need to be a developer! It's in my heart and soul to create awesome pages and applications that people can use and enjoy and can benefit the world. I joined UofU's bootcamp for web development and got my certification after having a very, very successful time (lowest grade on any of my own projects was 100%).

            Apart from this I am also an incredibly hard worker. I grew up on a rural farm in upstate NY and rain or snow cold or heat we were out taking care of the farm and the needs of the animals. I have taken that work ethic into other fields I've worked in. I am always up for a challenge and able to endure alot of problems that come with every field I've devoted myself to. I am very friendly and I like to add an air of positivity to any workplace of which I'm a part this includes working with you on a personal level. You can't ever stress me out with work because I can only do what I can do and I will be honest with you on what's possible and what's not. I try very hard to keep my prices as low as possible to help those without much but as well please keep in mind I have a family to feed as well so I do apologize if any quote I give isn't in your range. I try to work things out as possible because I know we all hit on rough times.</p>
            <h2>About this Page</h2>
            <p>This page is really just too give you a brief but comprehensive view of my capabilities. Even if you aren't a fan of the styling, that's easy to change. I built this page using React, Redux (overkill I know but I love using it), javascript, nodemailer, etc. I put everything I have into my work and my styling of this page hopefully brings that out... in an easily digestible way.</p>
